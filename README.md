# Reactive Light Up Hockey Goal

## Overview

This light up goal uses an array of Neopixels and a piezo sensor to sense vibration. When the hockey goal is hit with a puck, the piezo senses the vibration and triggers a flashing red and blue animation on the Neopixels driven by an Arduino Nano.

## To-Do

+ Create more animations for Neopixels

+ Move to Attiny85 and a dedicated PCB to create smaller package

+ Test threshold value for sensativity
